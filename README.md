## General info
This project is a simple version of a weather app. It uses two APIs to accomplish this. The first API is Open-Meteo (for weather data), and the second API is Big Data Cloud's Client Side Reverse Geocoding to City API (to display user's city from the latitude and longitude provided by the broswer). It also uses the Skycons SVG library for the weather icons.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JSES6
* APIs (Open-Meteo and Big Data Cloud)
	
## Setup
To run this project:

2. Allow browser to retrieve location information.
3. Choose one of the three tabs (current, hourly, or daily) to look at weather conditions and temperatures.
